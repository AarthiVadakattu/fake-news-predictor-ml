# üì∞ Fake News Predictor using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based project aimed at classifying news articles as **real** or **fake** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project combines efficient text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and powerful classification algorithms to tackle the modern-day challenge of misinformation.

---

## üìå Project Objective

- Develop a system that predicts the authenticity of a news article based on its **author** and **title**.
- Utilize classic ML algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest**.
- Achieve high accuracy through advanced text processing and feature engineering techniques.
- Demonstrate how **Machine Learning** and **NLP** can help in combating misinformation.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

- **Source:** Commonly available fake news datasets (e.g., [Kaggle Fake News](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data), LIAR, BuzzFeed, PolitiFact).
- **Type:** Tabular text data with the following columns:
  - `author`: Name of the news article's author.
  - `title`: Headline of the article.
  - `label`: `1` for fake, `0` for real.
- **Derived Column:**
  - `content`: A new column created by merging `author` and `title`.
